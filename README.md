# analysis_gw170814
GW170814 is a transient Gravitational Wave Signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar mass black holes, it was detected by the Advanced Virgo detector and the two Advanced LIGO detectors. I have been studying gravitational waves for a few months now and I used the GW modules and bilby framework to analyse it.
